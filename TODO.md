# TODO list

### General
- [ ] Add `N value` - number of all tests somewhere
- [ ] Maybe calculate and show `P (all positives)` and other values in matrix
- [ ] Use names and order as in http://www.dataschool.io/simple-guide-to-confusion-matrix-terminology/
- [ ] `About` tab - confusion matrix description
- [ ] `Measures` tab - classification meetrics description
- [ ] Additional help text (info box or somehtnig), which explains terms such as TP, TN, FP, FN ...
- [ ] Create a Release `v1.0` on Github
- [x] Setup `Contact` form

### Future:
- [ ] Add `Import` option, which would actually calculate CM from your CSV data *(This could be done with a simple node service - which could be hosted for free on Heroku. This static page could call that service, which would sometimes be slow, but the static website would still work)*
- [ ] You could also draw ROC and other plots from imported data
- [ ] Classification matrix with several classes 
- [ ] Create input table with AngularJs
- [ ] Import/Export functionality?
- [ ] Visualisations?

### Web hosting
- [x] Use Gihub pages for hosting
- [x] Buy a domain name `onlineconfusionmatrix.com`
- [x] Setup DNS to Github pages site
- [ ] Domain `errormatrix.com` is also free - maybe buy and make `301` redirect

### Monetization
- [x] Setup Google AdSense
